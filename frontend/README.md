# 🥗 MealMind

**MealMind** is a smart meal planning web app that helps you organize your weekly diet, track your macros, and never forget what to buy at the supermarket.

## What can you do with MealMind?

### Create your own recipes
Build your personal recipe library by searching from a database of 187+ ingredients with nutritional values already calculated. MealMind automatically computes the total calories, protein, carbs and fat for each recipe.

### Track your macros
Every recipe shows a detailed macro breakdown so you always know what you're eating. No manual calculations needed — MealMind does the math for you.

### Plan your weekly meals
Assign recipes to each meal of the day (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for every day of the week. Get a clear overview of your entire week at a glance.

### Generate your shopping list
Once your week is planned, MealMind automatically generates a shopping list with all the ingredients you need and the exact quantities. Check items off as you shop and mark the plan as complete when you're done.

### Personalize your account
Update your username, email and password from your profile at any time.
